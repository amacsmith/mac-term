# Exploration

**Research existing AI-powered terminal projects**

I've prepared some initial notes on TabNine and Codex. Let me share them with you:

**TabNine:**

* Context-aware code completion for various programming languages (Python, Java, C++, etc.)
* Large-scale training data from open-source code
* Focuses on language understanding to provide accurate suggestions

**Codex:**

* Real-time code completion based on natural language queries
* Cloud-based infrastructure for scalability and ease of integration
* Integrates with popular IDEs and text editors (e.g., Visual Studio Code, IntelliJ)

Some questions to consider:

1. How do these projects handle data storage and retrieval?
2. What types of data do they use to train their AI models?
3. Are there any commonalities or differences between TabNine's focus on language understanding and Codex's focus on natural language queries?
