# **Focus on Terminal:**

By focusing on the terminal, we can differentiate ourselves from other AI-powered code completion tools that are more general-purpose. Our goal is to
provide a tailored solution for terminal users, making it easier and more efficient for them to navigate and interact with their systems.

**Everyone Still Needs It:**

You're absolutely right! Even as technology advances, the need for effective command-line interfaces will continue to grow. Whether you're a system
administrator, developer, or power user, having a smart and helpful terminal companion can be incredibly valuable.

Now that we have our focus and differentiator, let's move on to exploring NLP libraries and frameworks!

**NLP Libraries and Frameworks:**

Some popular options include:

1. **NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)**: A comprehensive library for natural language processing tasks, including tokenization, stemming, and tagging.
2. **spaCy**: A modern NLP library focused on industrial-strength natural language understanding, with a strong focus on performance and ease of use.
3. **Stanford CoreNLP**: A Java library for NLP that provides a wide range of tools and resources for tasks like part-of-speech tagging, named entity
recognition, and sentiment analysis.
