# AI-Powered Terminal Project

Aims to simplify the command line interface by providing intelligent suggestions and improving productivity.

**Goals:**

1. Implement context-aware command autocompletion using machine learning.
2. Allow users to define custom sets of commands for quick access.
3. Improve UI/UX with natural language processing (NLP) support for command entry.
4. Provide predictive maintenance by analyzing system logs and updating tools.

**Features:**

1. Intelligent tab completion for commands and parameters.
2. Natural Language Processing (NLP) support for command entry.
3. Predictive maintenance by analyzing system logs and updating tools.
4. Customizable command sets for quick access.

**Technical Requirements:**

1. Machine learning framework (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch).
2. NLP library (e.g., NLTK, spaCy).
3. System logging API integration.

**Design Questions:**

1. How will we handle data storage and retrieval for training the AI model?
2. What types of data should we use to train the AI model, and how can we acquire or generate that data?
3. How will we balance the trade-off between accuracy and performance in our AI-powered terminal?

**To-Do List:**

1. Research existing AI-powered terminal projects (e.g., TabNine, Codex).
2. Explore NLP libraries and frameworks for integration.
3. Determine the scope of our AI model training data.
